# Project Diabetes Prediction

## Overview: 
This machine learning project is based on the prediction of diabetes with a given data.
By using logistic regression and random forest regression we will predict which data model is giving good accuracy.

## About dataset:
we worked on dataset from ***Pima tribe (also known as the Pima Indians) Diabetes dataset***.
>Pima Indians are a Native American group that lives in Mexico and Arizona, USA [3]. This group was deemed to have a high incidence rate of diabetes mellitus. Thus, research around them was thought to be significant to and representative of global health [4]. The Pima Indian Diabetes dataset consisting of Pima Indian females 21 years and older is a popular benchmark dataset [5]. This group is also significant to members of underrepresented minority or indigenous groups.
