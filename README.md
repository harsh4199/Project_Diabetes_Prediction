# Project Diabetes Prediction

## Overview: 
This machine learning project is based on the prediction of diabetes with a given data.
By using logistic regression and random forest regression we will predict which data model is giving good accuracy.

## About dataset:
we worked on dataset from ***Pima tribe (also known as the Pima Indians) Diabetes dataset***.
>Pima Indians are a Native American group that lives in Mexico and Arizona, USA. This group was deemed to have a high incidence rate of diabetes mellitus. Thus, research around them was thought to be significant to and representative of global health. The Pima Indian Diabetes dataset consisting of Pima Indian females 21 years and older is a popular benchmark dataset. This group is also significant to members of underrepresented minority or indigenous groups.

#### Content:
* Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant<br />
* Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test<br />
* Blood pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)<br />
* SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)<br />
* Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml) test<br />
* BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)<br />
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history<br />
* A ge: Age in years<br />
* Outcome: Class variable (0: the person is not diabetic or 1: the person is diabetic)

## Problem Statement:
Diabetes is a most common disease caused by a group of metabolic disorders. It is also known as Diabetic mellitus. It affects the organs of the human body. It can be controlled by predicting this disease earlier. If diabetics patient is untreated for a long time, it may lead to increase blood sugar. Now a days, Healthcare industries generating large volume of data. Machine Learning algorithms and statistics are used to predict the disease with the help of current and past data. Machine learning techniques helps the doctors to predict early stage for diabetics. Diabetics patient medical record and different types of algorithms are added in dataset for experimental analysis. we use logistic regression, random forest, decision tree classifier and gradient boosting to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. Performance and accuracy of the applied algorithms is discussed and compared.
